# Rick Clark

Hi, I'm Rick. I'm a **full stack junior web developer**.

I'm looking for a role where I can use my energy and intelligence to deliver exceptional software constructed with clean, tested and extendable code. I'd love to work in a team where I can continue to develop my software craftsmanship, taking my knowledge and expertise to the next level.

Over the past few months I have undergone a transformation from an enthusiastic amateur coder to an enthusiastic, confident and capable developer. I've graduated from the [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/), an experience that I can only describe as having poured rocket fuel on my learning! It's been the most remarkable experience of my adult life and I am excited to now be taking the next steps on my journey.

I come to the software development profession having previously worked for a number of years as a Business Analyst, during which time I have worked on a range of technology projects. It was by forming close relationships with my software development colleagues that I first became curious about code. I'm very glad I did. :)

## Projects & Code

| Project  | Description | Demo | Technologies Used |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| [Javascript Minesweeper](https://github.com/rkclark/minesweeper)  | I re-created the classic game Minesweeper with Javascript in order to practice my js, try the new Bootstrap 4 Alpha and explore how to use Gulp. The design is fully responsive and the game auto-sizes to your viewport. Note that it uses the Bootstrap 4 Alpha with Flexbox, so is only tested/stable with Chrome.  | [Link](https://rkclark.github.io/minesweeper/) | Javascript, Jquery, Sass, Bootstrap 4, Flexbox, Gulp |
| [Ardoq d3 Sunburst Plugin](https://github.com/rkclark/ardoq-sunburst-diagram)  | I created a new way to visualise hierarchical data in [Ardoq](https://ardoq.com/) via a Javascript plugin that generates a zoomable d3 sunburst diagram. This involved exploring Ardoq's Backbone.js data model and determining how to capture, manipulate and feed the relevant data into the d3 functions, as well as creating custom CSS.   | *Would require Ardoq* | Javascript, Jquery, CSS3, d3 |
| [Ardoq Multi-Bar Chart Plugin ](https://github.com/rkclark/ardoq-multi-bar-chart)  | This Javascript Ardoq plugin allows numerical data saved in a user's information model to be visualised via a d3 multi-bar chart. It significantly expands on the graphical visualisations available out-of-the-box by offering the user a number of un-precedented customisation options powered by my custom functions. [Quote from Ian Stendera at Ardoq](https://twitter.com/Ian_Stendera/status/809056969332064260): *"Seriously, people aren't going to believe that we didn't pay for this. If we can only get 10 more  @R_K_Clark s..."* | *Would require Ardoq* | Javascript, Jquery, d3, NVD3 |
