# Rick Clark

Hi, I'm Rick. I'm a **full stack junior web developer**.

I'm looking for a role where I can use my energy and intelligence to deliver exceptional software constructed with clean, tested and extendable code. I'd love to work in a team where I can continue to develop my software craftsmanship, taking my knowledge and expertise to the next level.

Over the past few months I have undergone a transformation from an enthusiastic amateur coder to an enthusiastic, confident and capable developer. I've graduated from the [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/), an experience that I can only describe as having poured rocket fuel on my learning! It's been the most remarkable experience of my life and I am excited to now be taking the next steps on my journey.

I come to the software development profession having previously had a career as a business analyst, during which time I have worked on and led a range of technology projects. It was by forming close relationships with my software development colleagues that I first became curious about code - I'm very glad I did :)

## Projects

All of my code is available on my [Github profile.](https://github.com/rkclark) Here are some projects that I am particularly proud of:

| Project  | Description | Demo | Technologies |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| [Steami ](https://github.com/rkclark/Steami)  | Universal Javascript app that allows to user to authenticate via [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/), and then summarises their profile, games and achievements by use of the [Steam Web API](https://steamcommunity.com/dev). I was the project owner having pitched the idea at the Makers Academy. I introduced my team mates to Node, Express and MongoDB, having previously taught myself the basics over a single weekend. We then learnt and implemented React from scratch together, as well as the associated testing and build technologies. This was all achieved in one week.  | [Heroku](http://steami.herokuapp.com/) |  MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js, Passport, Webpack, Bootstrap, Sass, Mocha, Chai, Enzyme |
| [Instaflash ](https://github.com/rkclark/instagram-challenge)  | Built in two days as an individual weekend challenge at the Makers Academy, this is a clone of Instagram that I constructed using Rails. This project gave me a chance to get my teeth into AJAX, which I used to handle user comments and likes. | [Heroku](http://rkclark-instaflash.herokuapp.com/) |  Rails, Devise, HAML, Postgresql, Paperclip, Bootstrap, Sass, RSpec, Capybara, Poltergeist |
| [Ardoq Multi-Bar Chart Plugin ](https://github.com/rkclark/ardoq-multi-bar-chart)  | Before joining the Makers Academy I created a Javascript visualisation plugin for information modelling tool [Ardoq](https://ardoq.com/) in my spare time. The plugin allows numerical data saved in a given Ardoq model to be visualised via a d3 multi-bar chart. It significantly expands on the graphical visualisations available out-of-the-box. [Tweet from Erik Bakstad, CTO and Co-Founder at Ardoq](https://twitter.com/ebaxt/status/808679988442632192): *"ItÂ’s so cool to see what @R_K_Clark is building on top of @ardoqCom"* | *Would require Ardoq* | Javascript, Jquery, d3, NVD3 |

## Skills

**Fast Learner** - I have always had an ability to absorb information and grasp new concepts quickly, following them through to high quality delivery. At the Makers Academy I successfully pitched a project idea to build a universal Javascript app using React - a technology neither I nor my team members had any experience with. I was able to quickly research the framework and guide my team members on its implementation - we completed a fully functional app called [Steami ](https://github.com/rkclark/Steami) in five days.

**Analytical Thinker** - During my previous role as a business analyst, I had the opportunity to lead a project to create a web app for calculating the expected costs associated with certain types of legal claim. This required me to communicate complex business logic to the software team. I used my initiative to construct an interactive wireframe model that linked the front end UI to logic trees describing the underlying calculations. I had very positive feedback from the development team as my model enabled a quick and straightforward build process.

**Explainer** - My ability to break down complex concepts and explain them in a logical, step-by-step manner has resulted in me becoming the 'go-to' person for fellow students at the Makers Academy in need of help and technical assistance. I've received wonderful feedback from the members of my cohort for my patience and willingness to help. I've also taught many the basics of technologies not covered on the course, such as Bootstrap, Sass, Express and MongoDB. It was a great feeling to watch them put their new knowledge into practice.
